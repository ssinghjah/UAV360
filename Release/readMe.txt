360 degree aerial video of Miami City and Angel Falls, Venezuela were encoded using H.265 codec at quantization parameters ranging from 0 to 50, in steps of 5. This dataset contains the frame sizes, frame types (I, B, or P), and PSNRs of each encoded frame for the above two scenarios, at the considered quantization parameters. The data is stored in .csv files, under the respective folders. Frame size is measured in bytes, while PSNR is measured in dB.
